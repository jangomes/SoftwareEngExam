Question 1

Please answer the question based on the following scenario: You are managing a software development team that has been invited by “Dorset Bank” to develop an operating system for their ATM machines. The ATM machines should allow clients to withdraw money at any time and deposit cash or checks. Additionally, the machines should display the client's account balance. You have 4 weeks to do this project.


a)	Select a development method for this project and provide the reason for your choice, (e.g. waterfall development method, agile development method, etc.).

The Waterfall methodology is going to be the best one in this case, as it is a small project that has the requirements well defined and also a well-defined timeline. The Waterfall will help to finish the entire process before going to the next, so it is going to be a step by step process to have sure that everything is working when you reach the end of the deadline. As it has to be a quickly process is good that everything is pre-defined because having only 4 weeks to accomplish the job there will be no possibility for use the agile where the project could have many changes, updates and the possibility for delays.

b)	Provide a comprehensive list of the steps involved in the software development process.

1 week - Requirements: Its where you will be having meetings and will be gathering information on the software needs.

1 week - Development: Here the project is going to start to be developed

1 week – Testing and QA: Here the project has to be tested to ensure that it is free o bugs and security problems for example, and has a good quality assurance. 

Ongoing - Deployment and Maintenance: Here the project will be deployed and the users will be able to give feedback and the project will be in a constant update.
